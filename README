OddSundays Recordings
============================

This is a little webapp to serve and manage the recordings
for the Odd Sundays project.

INSTALL:

1. You should install it using the RPM. To make an rpm:
 a. bump the version in lib/OddSundays.rpm and spec/perl-OddSundays.spec
 b. run "./script/build-rpm.sh".
 c. then do "sudo rpm -Uvh /path/to/rpm"

2. Then you'll need to set up the handler in the apache config, like this:

    <Location /odd-sundays>
        PerlSetEnv SQLITE_FILE /var/lib/odd-sundays/db/odd-sundays.sqlite
        PerlSetEnv TT_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/local/odd-sundays/templates
        PerlSetEnv UPLOAD_DIR /var/lib/odd-sundays/uploads
        PerlSetEnv URI_BASE /odd-sundays
        PerlSetEnv STATIC_URI_BASE /odd-sundays-static
        PerlSetEnv MGMT_URI_KEY xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
               # any random string will do, but "uuidgen" is your friend

        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler OddSundays::Controller::ModPerl
    </Location>

3. To create the sqlite database, run this

    sudo sh -c 'UPLOAD_DIR=/var/lib/odd-sundays/uploads/ 
                SQLITE_FILE=/var/lib/odd-sundays/db/odd-sundays.sqlite 
                ./script/odd-sundays-create-tables.pl'

4. The users can browse the files at:

    https://www.bacds.org/odd-sundays

and admins can upload and edit data at:

    https://www.bacds.org/odd-sundays/manage/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/

I didn't bother to set up usernames/passwords. That unguessable url is a "password".
It can be changed at will.

5. If you need to hack on the code, you can see where the files are by doing

    $ rpm -ql perl-OddSundays
    /usr/local/odd-sundays/templates
    /usr/local/odd-sundays/templates/footer.tt
    /usr/local/odd-sundays/templates/header.tt
    /usr/local/odd-sundays/templates/main-html.tt
    ...etc...

but please do the rpm route described in step #1 above, and send pull requests
to the github repo at https://github.com/kgoess/odd-sundays.
